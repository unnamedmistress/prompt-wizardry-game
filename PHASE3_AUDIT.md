## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Progression System
- **Level Gating**: Games can require minimum levels
- **Completion Tracking**: Games marked when completed
- **Replay Value**: All games can be replayed for practice

### Reward Distribution
- **AIIntroGame**: Score-based XP (0-100)
- **PromptBuilderGame**: 30-50 XP per challenge, 10 coins
- **ToneController**: 25 XP per challenge
- **RoleMatcher**: 20 XP per correct match

### Skill Improvements
Each game targets specific skills:
- `promptClarity`: AIIntroGame, PromptBuilderGame
- `creativityBalance`: ToneController
- `contextAwareness`: RoleMatcher
